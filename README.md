# Members photos

My first cracking at querying RDF using SPARQL. I queried the Parliament beta website for all current Members' names and links to their new photos. 

Take a look at the Ipython notebook for more information. You'll have to scroll past the first lot of RDF to get to the query that returns links to Members'photos.
